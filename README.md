# Hohmann Transfer

Hohmann transfer is a fuel-efficient orbital maneuver that allows the spacecraft to move from an initial parking orbit to a much larger final orbit via following the trajectory of a transfer ellipse. 
The project demonstrates an orbital maneuver for an earth-orbiting spacecraft from an initial circular orbit with a radius of 7000km to a final circular orbit of 15000km. 
An RK-4 integrator is used with a step size of 1s. Instantaneous thrust is provided within the given step.No additional perturbations are considered.
